In this project, we used Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to explore and understand the connections between the chemical and sensory aspects of wine. Our dataset consisted of measurements of various chemical and sensory properties of wine. By applying CCA, we were able to identify and understand the relationships between these two sets of variables. Our analysis provided valuable insights into the associations between the chemical composition of wine and its sensory attributes
